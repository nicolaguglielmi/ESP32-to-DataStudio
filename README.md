# ESP32-to-DataStudio
Script files for ESP32 to Datastudio, a Micropython serverless journey, Medium Tutorial

I have always thought that developing an hardware streamer reading values from one or more sensors and saving that values to the Cloud for storage and analytics would require a lot of effort, both on the hardware and coding side.
During Codemotion@Milan 2019 anyway, I got in touch with MicroPython and things have never been the sameâ€¦(Thx to Sebastian Roll)

This tutorial extends the awesome one of Carl Krauss that inspired me to go deep on this topic:

Here you will find all the scripts for inital tests and for the final application.
Kudos to Gus Class from which some scripts are forked:
